# Cafe Management System (A project to practice my skills)
<ins> <b>Note: the current version has been built up to the backend part</b> </ins>

This GitHub repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Cafe Management System, developed by BTech Days. The project is a full-stack application, crafted using Angular for the frontend, and ASP.net (C#) for the backend, and relies on an MS SQL Database for efficient data management.

This repository was created to track my coding skills development while following the BTech Days video series for the Cafe App. This way, I could practise on a real-life project and improve my skills in the technologies mentioned above. Again, it is important to note that this is not an original project of mine; rather, it is BTech Days' work, I just followed the tutorial and included the current work in my portfolio as evidence of my practice.
